\item Analysis of the data from the third phase of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) with $^3$He-filled proportional counters deployed to detect neutrons from the neutral-current disintegration of deuterium is nearly complete.  We have contributed extensively to the development of a detailed physics model of the current profiles of ionization events in these detectors to sort out neutron events from other kinds.  A number of other important questions that arose in the analysis have been addressed at UW by experimental and analytical work.  

\item The construction of the detector system, the US contribution to KATRIN, has moved forward quickly during the past year.  The superconducting magnets, the magnet support system,the multipixel Si PIN diode array, the vacuum system,  calibration equipment, and the electronics are now under construction with support from both DOE and the University.

\item We have determined the $^{22}{\rm Na}(p,\gamma)$ thermonuclear reaction rate for novae and have found large discrepancies with a previous experiment. Our results imply that the chance of observing the highly-sought (but so-far elusive) evidence of production of $^{22}{\rm Na}$ in novae is a bit harder than previously thought.
